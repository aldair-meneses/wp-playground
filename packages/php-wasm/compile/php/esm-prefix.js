     * Overrides Emscripten's default ExitStatus object which gets
     * thrown on failure. Unfortunately, the default object is not
     * a subclass of Error and does not provide any stack trace.
     *
     * This is a deliberate behavior on Emscripten's end to prevent
     * memory leaks after the program exits. See:
     *
     * https://github.com/emscripten-core/emscripten/pull/9108
     *
     * In case of WordPress Playground, the worker in which the PHP
     * runs will typically exit after the PHP program finishes, so
     * we don't have to worry about memory leaks.
     *
     * As for assigning to a previously undeclared ExitStatus variable here,
     * the Emscripten module declares `ExitStatus` as `function ExitStatus`
     * which means it gets hoisted to the top of the scope and can be
     * reassigned here â€“ before the actual declaration is reached.
     *
     * If that sounds weird, try this example:
     *
     * ExitStatus = () => { console.log("reassigned"); }
     * function ExitStatus() {}
     * ExitStatus();
     * // logs "reassigned"
     */
