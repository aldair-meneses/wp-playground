 *   reference filesystem used by all other PHP instances.
 * * A pool of disposable PHP instances that are spawned to handle a single
 *   request and reaped immediately after.
 *
 * When a new request comes in, PHPProcessManager yields the idle instance to handle it,
 * and immediately starts initializing a new idle instance. In other words, for n concurrent
 * requests, there are at most n+1 PHP instances running at the same time.
 *
 * A slight nuance is that the first idle instance is not initialized until the first
 * concurrent request comes in. This is because many use-cases won't involve parallel
 * requests and, for those, we can avoid eagerly spinning up a second PHP instance.
 *
 * This strategy is inspired by Cowboy, an Erlang HTTP server. Handling a single extra
 * request can happen immediately, while handling multiple extra requests requires
 * extra time to spin up a few PHP instances. This is a more resource-friendly tradeoff
 * than keeping 5 idle instances at all times.
