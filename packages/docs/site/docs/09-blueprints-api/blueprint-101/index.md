1. [What are Blueprints, and what can you do with them?](./01-what-are-blueprints-what-you-can-do-with-them.md)
2. [How to load and run Blueprints](./02-how-to-load-run-blueprints.md)
3. [Build your first Blueprint](./03-build-your-first-blueprint.md)
4. [Troubleshoot and debug Blueprints](./04-troubleshoot-debug-blueprints.md)

## Blueprints version 2

The team is exploring ways to transition Blueprints from a TypeScript library to a PHP library. This would allow people to run Blueprints in any WordPress environments: Playground, a hosted site, or a local setup.

The proposed [new specification](https://github.com/WordPress/blueprints-library/issues/6) is discussed on a separate [GitHub repository](https://github.com/WordPress/blueprints-library/), and youâ€™re more than welcome to join (there or on the [#meta-playground](https://wordpress.slack.com/archives/C04EWKGDJ0K) Slack channel) and help shape the next generation of Playground.
