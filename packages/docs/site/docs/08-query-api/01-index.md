# Query API

WordPress Playground exposes a simple API that you can use to configure the Playground in the browser.

It works by passing configuration options as query parameters to the Playground URL. For example, to install the pendant theme, you would use the following URL:

```text
https://playground.wordpress.net/?theme=pendant
```

You can go ahead and try it out. The Playground will automatically install the theme and log you in as an admin. You may even embed this URL in your website using an `<iframe>` tag:

```html
<iframe src="https://playground.wordpress.net/?theme=pendant"></iframe>
```

## Available options

| Option                 | Default Value         | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

Accepts `7.0`, `7.1`, `7.2`, `7.3`, `7.4`, `8.0`, `8.1`, `8.2`, `8.3`, or `latest`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

You can also use the generic values `latest`, `nightly`, or `beta`.                                                                                                                                                                   |
| `blueprint-url`        |                       | The URL of the Blueprint that will be used to configure this Playground instance.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

Accepts `kitchen-sink` (for finfo, gd, mbstring, iconv, openssl, libxml, xml, dom, simplexml, xmlreader, xmlwriter) or `light`. `light` reduces downloads by 6 MB and loads none of the extensions in `kitchen-sink`.                                                                                                                          |

| `plugin`               |                       | Installs the specified plugin. Use the plugin name from the WordPress Plugins Directory URL. For example, if the URL is `https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-lazy-loading/`, the plugin name would be `wp-lazy-loading`. You can pre-install multiple plugins by saying `plugin=coblocks&plugin=wp-lazy-loading&â€¦`. Installing a plugin automatically logs the user in as an admin. |
| `theme`                |                       | Installs the specified theme. Use the theme name from the WordPress Themes Directory URL.

| `lazy`                 |                       | Defer loading the Playground assets until someone clicks on the "Run" button. Does not accept any values. If `lazy` is added as a URL parameter, loading will be deferred.                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

| `storage`              | `none`                | Selects the storage for Playground: `none` gets erased on page refresh, `browser` is stored in the browser, and `device` is stored in the selected directory on a device. The last two protect the user from accidentally losing their work upon page refresh.                                                                                                                   |

| `import-wxr`           |                       | Imports site content from a WXR file specified by a URL. It uses the WordPress Importer plugin, so the default admin user must be logged in.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| `site-slug`            |                       | Selects which site to load from browser storage. This must be used in combination with `storage=browser`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| `language`             | `en_US`               | Sets the locale for the WordPress instance. This must be used in combination with `networking=yes` otherwise WordPress won't be able to download translations.                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

For example, the following code embeds a Playground with a preinstalled Gutenberg plugin and opens the post editor:

```html
<iframe src="https://playground.wordpress.net/?plugin=gutenberg&url=/wp-admin/post-new.php&mode=seamless"> </iframe>
```

## GitHub Export Options

The following additional query parameters may be used to pre-configure the GitHub export form:

-   `gh-ensure-auth`: If set to `yes`, Playground will display a modal to ensure the
    user is authenticated with GitHub before proceeding.
-   `ghexport-repo-url`: The URL of the GitHub repository to export to.
-   `ghexport-pr-action`: The action to take when exporting (create or update).

-   `ghexport-theme`: Theme directory name. When the content type is `theme`, pre-select the theme to export.
-   `ghexport-path`: A path relative to `ghexport-playground-root`. Can be provided multiple times. When the
    content type is `custom-paths`, it pre-populates the list of paths to export.
