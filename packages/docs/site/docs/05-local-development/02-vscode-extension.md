# VS Code extension

Start a zero-setup development environment using the [VS Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=WordPressPlayground.wordpress-playground), and develop your plugin or theme locally without installing Apache or MySQL.

:::info **Documentation**

The VS Code extension is maintained in a different GitHub repository, [Playground Tools](https://github.com/WordPress/playground-tools/). You can find the latest documentation in the [dedicated README file](https://github.com/WordPress/playground-tools/blob/trunk/packages/vscode-extension/README.md).

:::

The extension ships with a portable WebAssembly version of PHP and sets up WordPress to use SQLite. Once installed, all you have to do is click the **Start WordPress Server** button in VS Code:

import Image from '@theme/IdealImage';
import vsCodeScreenshot from '@site/static/img/start-wordpress-server.png';

<div style={{maxWidth:350}}><Image img={vsCodeScreenshot} /></div>
