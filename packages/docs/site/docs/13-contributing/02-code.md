# Code contributions

Like all WordPress projects, Playground uses GitHub to manage code and track issues. The main repository is at [https://github.com/WordPress/wordpress-playground](https://github.com/WordPress/wordpress-playground) and the Playground Tools repository is at [https://github.com/WordPress/playground-tools/](https://github.com/WordPress/playground-tools/).

:::info Contribute to Playground Tools

This guide includes links to the main repository, but all the steps and options apply for both. If you're interested in the plugins or local development tools—start there.

:::

Browse [the list of open issues](https://github.com/wordpress/wordpress-playground/issues) to find what to work on. The [`Good First Issue`](https://github.com/wordpress/wordpress-playground/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22Good+First+Issue%22) label is a recommended starting point for first-time contributors.

Be sure to review the following resources before you begin:

-   [Coding principles](./03-coding-standards.md)
-   [Architecture](../11-architecture/01-index.md)
-   [Vision and Philosophy](https://github.com/WordPress/wordpress-playground/issues/472)
-   [WordPress Playground Roadmap](https://github.com/WordPress/wordpress-playground/issues/525)

## Contribute Pull Requests

[Fork the Playground repository](https://github.com/WordPress/wordpress-playground/fork) and clone it to your local machine. To do that, copy and paste these commands into your terminal:

```bash
git clone -b trunk --single-branch --depth 1

# replace `YOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME` with your GitHub username:
git@github.com:YOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME/wordpress-playground.git
cd wordpress-playground
npm install
```

Create a branch, make changes, and test it locally by running the following command:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Playground will open in a new browser tab and refresh automatically with each change.

When your'e ready, commit the changes and submit a Pull Request.

:::info Formatting

We handle code formatting and linting automatically. Relax, type away, and let the machines do the work.

### Running a local Multisite

WordPress Multisite has a few [restrictions when run locally](https://developer.wordpress.org/advanced-administration/multisite/prepare-network/#restrictions). If you plan to test a Multisite network using Playground's `enableMultisite` step, make sure you either change `wp-now`'s default port or set a local test domain running via HTTPS.

To change `wp-now`'s default port to the one supported by WordPress Multisite, run it using the `--port=80` flag:

```bash
npx @wp-now/wp-now start --port=80
```

There are a few ways to set up a local test domain, including editing your `hosts` file. If you're unsure how to do that, we suggest installing [Laravel Valet](https://laravel.com/docs/11.x/valet) and then running the following command:

```bash
valet proxy playground.test http://127.0.0.1:5400 --secure
```

Your dev server is now available on https://playground.test.

## Debugging

### Use VS Code and Chrome

If you're using VS Code and have Chrome installed, you can debug Playground in the code editor:

-   Open the project folder in VS Code.
-   Select Run > Start Debugging from the main menu or press `F5`/`fn`+`F5`.

### Debugging PHP

Playground logs PHP errors in the browser console after every PHP request.
