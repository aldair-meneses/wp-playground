The JSON schema stored in this directory is used to validate the Blueprints
and is autogenerated from the Blueprints TypeScript types.

Whenever the types are modified, the schema needs to be rebuilt using
`nx build playground-blueprints` and then committed to the repository.

Unfortunately, it is not auto-rebuilt in `npm run dev` mode as the
`dts-bundle-generator` utility we use for type rollups does not support
watching for changes.
